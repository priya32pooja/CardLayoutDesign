                <h3>HTML</h3>
                <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be 
                   displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
                   and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                    HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its 
                    appearance.

                <h3>CSS</h3>
                <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a 
                   document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the 
                   World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
                   CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and 
                   fonts.

                <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript 
                   standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. 
                   It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. 
                   It has APIs for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and 
                   the Document Object Model.

                <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
                <p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web 
                   development. It contains HTML, CSS and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, 
                   forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.
                   Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS and JS library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages.
